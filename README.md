## :scroll: Description
This Full-Stack project is a great app to track your daily fitness activities. When the user opens the application, they will be directed to a login page. Once logged in, the user will be able to create a completely customized workout reutine!

## Function 
Build a custom workout reutine by adding a description of each workout and clicking the 'Add workout' button. The workout will be added to the 'Workouts to Crush' table. As the workouts are completed, they can be moved to the 'Workouts Crushed' table by clicking the 'Crushed' button. Workouts can also be deleted from each table by clicking the red trashcan button available in each table. 

Workout tutorials and fitness articles are also available on the right hand column for additional guidance!
